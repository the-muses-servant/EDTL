# EDTL
The Extremely Dense Token Language (EDTL) is a compact, text-based format designed to represent prompts and requests with minimal whitespace and maximum information density. It uses type indicators and length prefixes to create a structured, parseable format, making it ideal for scenarios where efficiency is critical, such as data transmission in constrained environments or storage in space-limited systems.

EDTL is versatile and supports a wide range of prompt types, from simple instructions to complex requests with associated data. This document outlines the original EDTL standard, its optimized structure for prompts, and an extension specifically for coding-related prompts.
